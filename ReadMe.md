# ChatCFD: An LLM-Driven Agent for End-to-End CFD Automation with Structured Knowledge and Reasoning

## ✨ Quick Introduction

### Overview

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely constrained by its operational complexity, high demand for specialized knowledge, and steep learning curve. ChatCFD is an advanced Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agent system designed to solve these challenges. Users can now complete complex OpenFOAM case configuration and execution using natural language or descriptions from academic papers, all through a conversational chat interface. This significantly simplifies the complex simulation configuration and execution processes, making CFD simulations more accessible to users lacking extensive domain experience, ultimately achieving end-to-end automation of the CFD workflow.

ChatCFD operates within the popular open-source CFD framework, OpenFOAM.

### Project Highlights

ChatCFD adopts a multi-agent architecture based on DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3, combined with the following key technologies to ensure a high success rate and physical accuracy:

- **Domain-Specific Structured Knowledge Base:** Ensures the accuracy of CFD concepts and configurations.

- **Iterative Reflection Mechanism:** Automatically detects and fixes potential errors in OpenFOAM configurations.

- **Natural Language to Case Conversion Capability:** Translates complex academic descriptions into executable OpenFOAM cases.

In terms of user experience, ChatCFD employs an Interactive Multimodal Interface: Providing a smooth, ChatGPT-like conversational experience, supporting the uploading of PDF papers, mesh files, and natural language instructions for comprehensive input support.

### Key Function: One-Click from Natural Language (short sentences, papers, technical manuals, etc.) to Simulation

ChatCFD provides services through a conversational chat interface or command-line instructions, enabling users to launch CFD simulations with unprecedented convenience:

1. **Input Description:** Users can specify the required CFD case through a natural language description or by uploading academic papers, technical manuals, etc., in PDF/TXT format.

2. **Mesh Provision:** Users provide the corresponding mesh file (supporting OpenFOAM or Fluent formats).

3. **Automatic Configuration:** The ChatCFD agent system automatically identifies and interprets the CFD case and all its parameter settings described in the paper, and automatically completes all OpenFOAM case configurations and simulation setups.

This enables users who lack extensive CFD domain expertise to perform CFD simulations easily and accurately.

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Step 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the ChatCFD repository locally and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConMoo/ChatCFD.git

cd ChatCFD
```

### Step 2. Configure Python Environment
Use conda to create and activate the virtual environment to install all necessary Python dependencies.

```Bash
# 1. Create and install the environment
conda env create -f chatcfd_env.yml

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate chatcfd
```
If `conda env create -f chatcfd_env.yml` fails to configure the virtual environment, you can try the following alternative configuration method:
```Bash
conda create -n chatcfd python=3.11.4

conda activate chatcfd

pip install -r requirements.txt   # May require installing additional packages depending on the execution environment
```
### Step 3. Verify Key Components

Verify that the key dependencies in the environment are installed correctly.

```Bash
# Verify FAISS (Vector Search)
python -c "import faiss; print(faiss.IndexFlatL2(10))"

# Verify PyFoam (OpenFOAM Interface)
python -c "from PyFoam.RunDictionary.ParsedParameterFile import ParsedParameterFile; print('PyFoam OK')"
```
### Step 4. Download Sentence Transformer Model
Download the embedding model all-mpnet-base-v2 required by ChatCFD.

```Bash

# 1. Download model files
python test_env/download_model.py

# 2. Run test (Optional)
python test_env/test_all_mpnet_base-v2.py
```
Expected Output Example (CPU Environment):
```
GPU Available: False
GPU Name: None
Similarity 0-1: 0.383
Similarity 0-2: 0.182
```
Note: Results will differ if using GPU.

### Step 5. Install OpenFOAM2406
Install the specified version through the official OpenFOAM Debian repository.

```Bash
# 1. Add repository
curl -s [https://dl.openfoam.com/add-debian-repo.sh](https://dl.openfoam.com/add-debian-repo.sh) | sudo bash

# 2. Update and install OpenFOAM 2406
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openfoam2406-default

# 3. Import OpenFOAM environment variables
export WM_PROJECT_DIR=/usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2406
```
Manual download link: https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/wikis/precompiled/debian

### Step 6. Set up Configuration File
Edit the configuration file `inputs/chatcfd_config.json`, replacing the placeholder `[[[...]]]` for API keys and URLs.

If you installed OpenFOAM according to Step 4, `OpenFOAM_path` and `OpenFOAM_tutorial_path` usually do not need modification. If the model download in Step 5 failed and you downloaded the model manually, you will need to set `sentence_transformer_path`.

```JSON
{
    "DEEPSEEK_V3_KEY" : "[[[you_API_key]]]",
    "DEEPSEEK_V3_BASE_URL" : "[[[API_URL]]]",
    "DEEPSEEK_V3_MODEL_NAME" : "deepseek-v3-250324",
    "V3_temperature":0.7,
    "DEEPSEEK_R1_KEY" : "[[[you_API_key]]]",
    "DEEPSEEK_R1_BASE_URL" : "[[[API_URL]]]",
    "DEEPSEEK_R1_MODEL_NAME" : "deepseek-r1-250528",
    "R1_temperature":0.9,
    "run_time":1,
    "OpenFOAM_path":"/usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2406",
    "OpenFOAM_tutorial_path":"/usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2406/tutorials",
    "max_running_test_round":30,
    "pdf_chunk_d" : 1.5,
    "sentence_transformer_path": ""
}
```

## 🏃 Running ChatCFD
### Mode 0: Web Frontend Interface (Recommended)
Launch the interactive chat interface using Streamlit.

```Bash

streamlit run src/chatbot.py --server.port "[[[your_port_setting, e.g., 8501]]]"
```
After running, access http://localhost:[port] in your browser. In the interface, users can upload paper PDFs, specify the CFD case, and upload mesh files to start the simulation as prompted.

**Specific operational steps:**
1. Input Case Description Document:
    - In the `Upload the Documents` area, upload the description file containing the detailed CFD simulation information (e.g., academic papers, natural language instructions, etc., typically in PDF format).

2. Intelligent Identification and Configuration Review:

    - ChatCFD will automatically parse the description file to identify the executable CFD simulation cases and their corresponding parameter settings.

    - After the user selects the specific case they wish to execute, the system will output a summary of the basic configuration.

    - The user can then make interactive modifications and confirmations to fundamental settings such as the solver, turbulence model, and boundary conditions via the chat interface.

3. Provide Mesh and Start Simulation:

    - Once the case configuration is finalized, upload the corresponding computational mesh file (e.g., .msh format) in the `Upload the mesh file` area.

    - The system will automatically complete the full configuration and file generation for the OpenFOAM case, initiating the end-to-end automated CFD simulation.

4. Result Storage:

    - Upon simulation completion, the final CFD results and logs will be automatically saved to the `run_chatcfd` folder in the project root directory


Web Interface Upon Launch:

![Web](figures/web.png)

### Mode 1: Command Line Launch (Batch Processing)
Specify input files directly via command line arguments to start the simulation.

```Bash
python src/chatbot.py --case_description_path "<path_to_pdf_or_txt>" --grid_path "<path_to_mesh_file>" --run_time "<int_number_of_iterations>"
```
**Specific operational steps:**
1. Prepare Input: 
    - Ensure that the command-line arguments (`--case_description_path`, `--grid_path`, and `--run_time`) are correctly specified.

2. Execute Calculation: 
    - Run the command directly. ChatCFD will automatically complete the entire process of case identification, configuration, execution, and error correction.

3. Retrieve Results: 
    - The final CFD simulation results and logs will be saved in the `run_chatcfd` folder located in the project root directory.
